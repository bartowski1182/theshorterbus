# theshorterbus

Currently runs though all character pages in characters/ directory. The first line of the file is armory information.

All proceeding lines are assumed to be trinkets. May switch to having each character have their own trinket file.

Will also toy with idea of removing trinkets from the initial baseline if people want that.

May also experiment with dynamic arrays for trinkets. I have a couple lazy things in there already though so maybe not.

Currently working on: receiving trinket list from server or something. dunno

Future work: parse the XML results and get interesting information such as stat priorities (only for highest dps run? maybe.)
                    - shouldn't be too too hard, predictable XML is fairly easy to parse, just need to find right tool
             host the .html results on theshorterbus.com

parse all trinket combinations (n choose 2)

use kate's extension to parse XML

use kate's other assignment for parsing from a DB and run an EXE? and then display stuffs
